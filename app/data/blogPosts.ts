          "A private ruling provides a non-profit organization with a legal interpretation regarding the application of the Income Tax Law 2009 to a specific situation. It is not a ‘tax exemption certificate’ or a ‘tax compliance certificate’. A private ruling provides an interpretation based on disclosed business activities but does not confirm compliance with the law.",

To qualify, the organization must: Operate on a non-profit basis exclusively for educational, cultural, literary, scientific, or charitable purposes. Contributors, shareholders, members, and employees cannot benefit from the organization during its operation or upon its dissolution. Register with the Ministry of Economy under the Law on Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).

If the organization believes a bilateral agreement exempts it from tax liability, it may: Do nothing and assume no tax liability, submit a letter request to ARD for a private ruling, or refer to a group ruling obtained from ARD by the donor country or organization.

If the difference between the amount realized and the taxpayer’s cost (after expenses) is a loss, then this also needs to be reported. The Income Tax Law also imposes a fixed tax of one percent of the sale or transfer of movable or immovable property. If the sale or transfer is made by a legal person, the fixed tax will be allowed as a credit against tax payable for annual income tax purposes. If the sale is made by an individual, the fixed tax will apply instead of annual income tax.",

        paragraph:
          "Interest income is the gain you receive on amounts that you have lent to others. Dividends are distributions from companies that you have invested in, whether received as money or as property. Dividends are also any benefit provided to you as a shareholder, including: 1. Any tangible or intangible assets 2. Shares in the company 3. Discounts on any purchases from the company 4. Loans to shareholders 5. The use of any company property. The taxable portion of the benefit is the difference between the fair market value (its cost to the general public) and the amount paid for it. Example: ABC Corporation sells electronics equipment. Shareholders of ABC Corporation may purchase equipment directly from the company at a 40 percent discount on the retail price (fair market value). Ahmad is a shareholder and buys a piece of equipment for AFN 6,000. The fair market value of the equipment is AFN 10,000. Ahmad would have to report the benefit of AFN 4,000 as income on his tax return. Income you receive for renting property that you own is subject to income tax. The rental payments may be subject to withholding tax. See Guide 01 Withholding on Rental Services for more information. Royalties are amounts you receive for the purchase or use of items that you have produced, such as books, films, music, etc. Royalties are also subject to income tax. Prizes (whether in cash or property), winnings, gratuities, bonus payments, etc., are also subject to income tax.",

        paragraph:
          "The following receipts are not subject to income tax and not included in returns of natural and legal persons: 1. Grants, gifts, and awards of the State 2. Grants, gifts, and awards of foreign governments, nonprofit organizations or international organizations, for contributions to science, art, literature, social progress, and international understanding 3. Scholarships, fellowships, and grants for professional and technical training 4. Health, accident, and unemployment insurance benefits 5. Life insurance paid on death 6. Compensation or damages for personal injuries or sickness or restitution of reputation 7. Proceeds of borrowing 8. Proceeds of issues of stocks and bonds by companies 9. Acquisition of property in connection with mergers of domestic corporations and other legal entities 10. Acquisition of movable or immovable property through expropriation of property of debtors by creditors 11. Payments on principal received from debtors 12. Interest on bonds issued by the State and by municipalities, and 13. Any other receipts according to the provisions of the Income Tax Law. Grants, gifts, and awards of State do not include payments made to employees for services performed in the ordinary course of duty. Grants, gifts, and awards are given in special circumstances or in recognition of unusual service. They are associated with hardship or recognition of accomplishment and are therefore non-taxable. Annual bonuses, overtime, back pay and other benefits given on a nonselective basis are taxable income of the recipient. Example 1: A family is struck by a natural disaster. This family receives AFN 5,000 as a gift from the State. This AFN 5,000 is not taxable income for any of the members of the family. Example 2: A medical doctor devotes his life to building medical clinics and providing medical services in several communities. The State honors him with a certificate and also a cash award. The cash award is exempt from taxation. Example 3: The receipt of a Nobel prize is an award of an international, nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation. All of the money received in connection with a scholarship, fellowship, or grant for professional and technical training is exempt. This includes travel funds and living expenses, as well as reimbursement for tuition, fees, cost of books and supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. Example: A student receives a scholarship which covers his travel, hotel bills, lodging, tuition, fees, books, medical costs, etc., plus an allowance for clothing, food, and personal expenses of AFN 5,000 per month. All of this is exempt from taxation. If the student receives a supplement from the State, this supplement is also exempt from taxation. If, however, as an employee of the State, he receives all or part of his salary from the State, this salary is subject to taxation. Payment received from an insurance company as a result of loss, misfortune, sickness, etc., for which the recipient was insured is not taxable. Example 1: An individual insured himself against sickness and injury with an insurance company to which he paid monthly premiums. He was injured in an accident which caused a disability and resulted in medical expenses. Under terms of his insurance policy he was paid AFN 10,000,000 in settlement of his claim. This payment is not taxable. Example 2: An individual is injured while working at his job. His employer carries an insurance policy which covers all his employees. The insurance company pays the injured employee AFN 10,000,000 in settlement of his claim. This receipt is exempt from taxation even though the injured employee did not pay the premium for the insurance coverage.",

        subtitle: "Introduction",
        paragraph:
          "The Income Tax Law of 2009 outlines a formal administrative dispute resolution process for individuals dissatisfied with their tax assessments in Afghanistan. Article 89 of the law provides a structured approach involving three main steps: requesting an amendment, lodging an objection, and appealing to a court. This guide aims to explain the dispute resolution process, including how to request an amendment or file an objection to a tax assessment, along with the procedures and timeframes the Afghanistan Revenue Department (ARD) follows. Understanding the taxation system in Afghanistan is crucial for taxpayers who need to navigate these processes. Resources such as the Taxation System in Afghanistan PDF and the Afghanistan Tax Calculator can assist taxpayers in understanding their tax obligations.",

        paragraph:
          "If a taxpayer believes their tax return or assessment is incorrect, they can request an amendment or lodge an objection. Situations where a formal amendment request or objection can be made include: An error is discovered in a filed income tax return or business receipts tax form. The ARD revises the tax payable or imposes penalties and issues an assessment notice. No tax return or form has been filed, but the ARD has issued an assessment imposing income tax, business receipts tax, or penalties. A fixed tax is imposed as a final tax instead of an annual income tax. Understanding the Afghanistan Tax Law is essential to determine whether an amendment request or objection is appropriate. For instance, rent tax in Afghanistan is a common area where disputes may arise, and knowing the specifics of the law can guide the amendment process. However, formal amendment requests or objections cannot be made for matters such as withholding tax calculations, fixed taxes on imports or exports, enforcement actions, or any interpretations of law provided in public or private rulings.",

If an assessment is not received within 30 days before this period expires, the request can be made within 30 days of receiving the assessment.
