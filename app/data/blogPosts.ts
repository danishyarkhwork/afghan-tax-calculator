          "A private ruling provides a non-profit organization with a legal interpretation regarding the application of the Income Tax Law 2009 to a specific situation. It is not a ‘tax exemption certificate’ or a ‘tax compliance certificate’.

To qualify, the organization must: Operate on a non-profit basis exclusively for educational, cultural, literary, scientific, or charitable purposes. Contributors, shareholders, members, and employees cannot benefit from the organization during its operation or upon its dissolution. Register with the Ministry of Economy under the Law on Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
